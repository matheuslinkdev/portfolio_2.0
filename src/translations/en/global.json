I've always been into the world of technology but never knew where to go until a cousin already established in the field recommended programming to me, and since then, I've been striving every day to become a Developer and above all, a successful person! Currently, I am part of a team of Freelancer friends, which I am sure is helping me to evolve more and more. ðŸš€",
